It's less 'bonsai' and more 'bonsai-gone-wild,' wouldn't you say? \ud83d\ude1c\n\nVisual Description: A slightly blurry photo of a tree that has been aggressively pruned and shaped into an abstract, almost comical form. Some branches are bent at odd angles, others are twisted into spirals. The person taking the photo seems to be standing back, looking at the tree with an amused expression, their face partially visible.",
