Choose an interest that can be visually represented.\n2. Combine the interest with a neutral emotion.\n3. Keep it concise and within the word limit.\nPosted a photo of their latest chaotic tree shaping creation, looking thoughtful.\n",

        "content": "The user wants an Instagram caption for Kaos Klinger.\nThe caption needs to be short (under 25 words) and describe a photo of a half-finished, chaotically creative jigsaw puzzle.\nKaos's mood is neutral, so the caption should be simple and slightly quirky.\nI should use words associated with Kaos's personality, like 'chaotic' and 'creative'.\n\nPlan:\n- Start with a simple statement about the puzzle.\n- Inject some of Kaos's personality.\n- Add a suggestion for a visual description.\nVisual description: A close-up of a jigsaw puzzle with pieces scattered around, some forming recognizable shapes, others seemingly placed at random.\n\nCurrent state of my sanity:  A bit like this puzzle. Creative chaos, you know?\n",
