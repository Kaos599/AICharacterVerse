Just a typical Tuesday, really. \ud83e\udd14\n\nVisual Description: A close-up shot of a bonsai tree twisted into an unusual, almost question mark shape. Kaos's blurred figure is visible in the background, seemingly gazing at the tree with a hand on their chin.",

It's a metaphor for life, wouldn't you say? Or maybe I just need more coffee.\n\nVisual Description: A close-up shot of a jigsaw puzzle, roughly half completed. Various pieces are scattered around the assembled section. Kaos's hand (or part of their arm) is visible in the frame, resting near the puzzle, perhaps tapping a piece thoughtfully.",
